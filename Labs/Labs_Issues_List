Issue:
I cant define new row names unless they are put in quotation marks:

my solution:

  SELECT account_id,
       FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'PRIJEM', amount, 0))) AS "incoming amount",
       FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'VYDAJ', amount, 0))) AS "outgoing amount",
       FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'PRIJEM', amount,0))) - FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'VYDAJ', amount,0))) AS "difference"
FROM trans
WHERE account_id= 396
GROUP BY 1;

solution given by IH:

SELECT
    account_id,
    FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'PRIJEM', amount, 0))) AS incoming_amount,
    FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'VYDAJ', amount, 0))) AS outgoing_amount,
    FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'PRIJEM', amount, 0))) - FLOOR(SUM(IF(type = 'VYDAJ', amount, 0))) AS difference
FROM trans
WHERE account_id = 396
GROUP BY 1;
